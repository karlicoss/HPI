    Seems that your HPI is installed as editable and uses flat layout ( my/ directory next to .git folder).
    This was the case in older HPI versions (pre-20250123), but now src-layout is recommended ( src/my/ directory next to .git folder).

    Reinstall your HPI as editable again via 'pip install --editable /path/to/hpi'.
    See https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/issues/316 for more info.
