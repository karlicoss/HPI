NOTE: you shouldn't modify this file.
You probably want to edit your personal config (check via 'hpi config check' or create with 'hpi config create').

See https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI/blob/master/doc/SETUP.org#setting-up-modules for info on creating your own config

This file is used for:
- documentation (as an example of the config structure)
- mypy: this file provides some type annotations
- for loading the actual user config
