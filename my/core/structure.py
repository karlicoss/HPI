    """
    Given a 'base' directory or archive (zip/tar.gz), recursively search for one or more paths that match the
    pattern described in 'expected'. That can be a single string, or a list
    of relative paths (as strings) you expect at the same directory.

    If 'partial' is True, it only requires that one of the items in
    expected be present, not all of them.

    This reduces the chances of the user misconfiguring gdpr exports, e.g.
    if they archived the folders instead of the parent directory or vice-versa

    When this finds a matching directory structure, it stops searching in that subdirectory
    and continues onto other possible subdirectories which could match

    If base is an archive, this extracts it into a temporary directory
    (configured by core_config.config.get_tmp_dir), and then searches the extracted
    folder for matching structures

    This returns the top of every matching folder structure it finds

    As an example:

    export_dir
    ├── exp_2020
    │   ├── channel_data
    │   │   ├── data1
    │   │   └── data2
    │   ├── index.json
    │   ├── messages
    │   │   └── messages.csv
    │   └── profile
    │       └── settings.json
    └── exp_2021
        ├── channel_data
        │   ├── data1
        │   └── data2
        ├── index.json
        ├── messages
        │   └── messages.csv
        └── profile
            └── settings.json

    Giving the top directory as the base, and some expected relative path like:

    with match_structure(Path("export_dir"), expected=("messages/messages.csv", "index.json")) as results:
        # results in this block is (Path("export_dir/exp_2020"), Path("export_dir/exp_2021"))

    This doesn't require an exhaustive list of expected values, but its a good idea to supply
    a complete picture of the expected structure to avoid false-positives

    This does not recursively decompress archives in the subdirectories,
    it only unpacks into a temporary directory if 'base' is an archive

    A common pattern for using this might be to use get_files to get a list
    of archives or top-level gdpr export directories, and use match_structure
    to search the resulting paths for an export structure you're expecting
