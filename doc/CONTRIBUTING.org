- I don't use automatic code formatters (like =black=)

  I don't mind if you do, e.g. when you're adding new code or formatting some code you modified, but please don't reformat the whole repository or slip in unrelated code style changes.

  In particular I can't stand when formatters mess with vertically aligned code (thus making it less readable!), or conform the code to some arbitrary line length (like 80 symbols).

  Of course reasonable formatting improvements (like obvious typos, missing spaces or too dense code) are welcome.
  And of course, if we end up collaborating a lot on the project I'm open to discussion if automatic code style is really important to you.
